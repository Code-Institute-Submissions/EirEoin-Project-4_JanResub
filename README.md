# DailyGalway 

## Who we are

I created DailyGalway with one thing in mind, to keep Galway connected. 
Since the Pandemic people have never felt so un-attached to their city. We at DailyGalway want one place for the people, made by the people. We listened to the People, The public even and took an Agile approach to this Community. We heard what the people wanted and listed them all in Github Projects to keep our eyes on the goals.
Throughout the whole process of building the site we were marking whats done , being done, currently and what's to-do. 
This process really kept us in line and driven to a beautiful end goal. 
To keep local topics, events and on-goings together online in one place. Users can post, comment and interact with the blog aswell as other users. We love what we have done and we hope to continue growing in this beautiful space. Go to Galway, Today!

## Bugs

When deploying this Project to Heroku I encountered many problems with connecting PostGres and fully connecting my repositiory to Heroku. I solved this problem by installing a few more requirements and importing correctly.
Indentation errors threw me back at first but finding them became easier throughout the build.
Migrating succesfully was also a problem but once I fixed a spelling mistake we were on our way.
When I turned DEBUG off before deployment, connection to my css was interuppted. I troubleshot that on google and found a small insert of code to fix the problem in the settings. 

The buttons on the Navbar did not work for registering or logging in but after a few tests we got them connecting correctly. The same issue came up when i turned DEBUG off.
The Comment section threw an error at me for a while but we got the sign in linked to it, aswell as a pop up that times out once a comment is made.

Github did not "add" or "push" anything to my repository succesfully after a whole late night session, even though it responded "Everything-up-to-date". This problem caused a lot of distress and worry. I had to try remember features i added, changed and discarded throughout the previous evening.

Heroku took an hour to deploy before submission so I was running through my code lookking for mistakes frantically troubleshooting but thankfully it deployed without any errors.

## Deployment 

The site was created using Github and deployed using heroku. The process began on github, connected my repository to heroku + PostGres and deployed on there too. It took some altering and lot of trial and Error but we truly hope everyone enjoys our creation.

## Credits 

I used The Coding Institute lessons in The Agile Development, HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Django and Postgres to Build this project. I used w3schools.com for some help with functions and model builds. I browsed well populated and heavily user Reddit for inspiration. I also used PEP - 8 to work with Python and realpython.com with the testing.
I also used Stackoverflow alot to troubleshoot any problems I have.
I used the Coding Institute Slack group for help Daily on this project, Thank you especially to everyong on there and to the tutor support!
